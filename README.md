# Fake New-York-Times page

This is an exercise from the online bootcamp 'Odin Project'.

Instructions can be found here :

https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/positioning-and-floating-elements

This was meant to practice the HTML5 new semantics, and also positioning and floating elements.

I could also practice flexbox, as well as images and videos integration.
