            <p>
              CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
              physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment
              at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
              venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
            </p>
            <p>
              He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
              particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead
              he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin
              with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution
              could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted
              a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the
              speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
            </p>
            <p>
              If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the
               heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged,
               warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the
               wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing,
               but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
            </p>
            <p>
              “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the
              page and drew a double box around it.
            </p>
            <p>
              On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported
               that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his
               hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of
              cosmic time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of
              astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian
              Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of
              space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a
              universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a
              trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old.
              They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation,
              proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
            </p>
            <p>
              Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though
               many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
            </p>
            <p>
              If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in
              science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing
               the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast
               realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see,
              extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of
              billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger
              cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable.
              Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number
               of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of
               pasta water boiling over.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong class="sub-title">‘As Big as It Gets’</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
              operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle
              accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself.
              Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of
              gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of
              general relativity, should ruffle space-time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe
              expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big
              as it gets.”
            </p>
            <p>
              He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe,
              sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a
              bath of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a
              picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot
               as the surface of the sun.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as
              Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic
              Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at
              the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of
              papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

                  is just under 14 billion years old. From our position in the
                  Milky Way galaxy, we can observe a sphere that is now about 92
                  billion light-years across. But there's a mystery. Wherever

                  The universe is not old enough for light to have traveled the
                  vast distance from one side of the universe to the other, and
                  there has not been enough time for scattered patches of hot
                  and cold to mix into an even temperature.

                  in one direction. You see a coffee cup, and from the amount
                  of steam, you can estimate its temperature and how much it

                  Now turn around and look a mile in the other direction. You
                  see a similar coffee cup, at exactly the same temperature.
                  Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup in every

                   to place before they get cold. But if all the coffee cups
                   were somehow filled from a single coffee pot, all at the

                  solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than a
                  trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, the universe
                  expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in the
                  violently expanding energy field eventually grew into the
                  large-scale structures of the universe.

                  fluctuations in swirls of polarized light in the cosmic
                  background radiation, which is energy left over from the
                  early universe. These are gravitational waves predicted by
                  Einstein.

          </p>
          <p>
            Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had
            not expected such a definite confirmation in his lifetime.
          </p>
          <p>
            “With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have
            been lucky.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’
             worth of observations and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a
             leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select
             few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts
             Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping
             that night in 1979), in his office last week.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as
            scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who chose his words as carefully as he
             tended his radio telescopes.

            Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described
             the most popular variant of inflation, known as chaotic inflation,
              in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week
              when Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr.
              Kovac’s team, knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne to
              tell him the news.

            Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had
             ordered anything.
          </p>
          <p>
            “And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was
            a delivery but we did not think that we ordered anything, but I
            simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde
             wrote in an email.
          </p>
          <p>
            Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he
            was still hyperventilating. “Having news like this is the best way
            of spoiling a vacation,” he said.

            By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that
            inflation had been seen and news spread, astrophysicists responded
            with a mixture of jubilation and caution.
          </p>

            Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think
            that if this stays true, it will go down as one of the greatest
            discoveries in the history of science.”
          </p>
          <p>
            John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor
            and head of a competing project called the South Pole Telescope,
            pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think the results are
             beautiful and very convincing,” he said.

            Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation
            that posits the clash of a pair of universes as the cause of genesis,
            said that if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his model, but
            he expressed reservations about inflation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the
            need for confirmation, noting that the new results exceeded earlier
            estimates based on temperature maps of the cosmic background by the
            European Space Agency’s Planck satellite and other assumptions about
            the universe.
          </p>
          <p>
            “So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr.
            Krauss said.
          </p>
          <p>
            Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft
            will report its own findings this year. At least a dozen other teams
            are trying similar measurements from balloons, mountaintops and space.

            <strong>Spirals in the Sky</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of
             the cosmic microwaves, which were discovered accidentally by Arno
             Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the
             Nobel Prize.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these
            waves. He is one of four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a
            series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole,
            where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The
            others are Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie Bock
             of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on
            the ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has been there 23 times, he said,
            wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.

                The Bicep2 telescope, in the foreground, was used to detect
                 the faint spiraling gravity patterns — the signature of a
                 universe being wrenched violently apart at its birth.

            What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at
            least a trillion trillionfold — from a submicroscopic speck of
            primordial energy to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a cosmic
            eye-blink.
          </p>
          <p>
            Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary
            particles and radiation. All of normal cosmic history was still ahead,
             resulting in today’s observable universe, a patch of sky and stars
             billions of light-years across. “It’s often said that there is no
              such thing as a free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes to say, “but the
              universe might be the ultimate free lunch.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting
             from Dr. Guth’s original vision suggest that inflation, once
              started, is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a
               comfortable homey expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue
                blowing up, spinning off other bubbles endlessly, a concept
                known as the multiverse.
          </p>
          <p>
            So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not
             bother asking about going any deeper into the past.
          </p>
          <p>
            We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very
            beginning, because inflation erases everything that came before it.
             All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are swept
             away, forever out of our view.
          </p>
          <p>
            “If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a
            Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who was not part of the team,
            “you wind up at inflation.”
